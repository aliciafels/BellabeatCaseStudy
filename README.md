# BellabeatCaseStudy
This is a data analytics project as one of the requirements for the [Google Data Analytics Specialization Certificate] (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) through Coursera.

**Mock Scenario:** I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat. I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat's products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. 


### 1. Ask

Bellabeat wants me to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. Then I have to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in my presentation. The following questions will help guide my analysis:

- What are some trends in smart device usage?

- How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?

- How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?


### 2. Prepare

The data that I will be analyzing during this case study is the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CCO: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius), which is a Kaggle data set.

It is also mentioned that this data set might have some limitations, and I am encouraged to consider adding another data to help address those limitations as I begin to work more with this data.
